      <p>
        Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness
        in humans. They are called “corona” because of crown-like spikes on the
        surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle
        East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of
        coronaviruses that cause illness in humans. The new strain of
        coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was first reported in Wuhan, China in
        December 2019. It has since spread to every country around the world.<br /><br />
        Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live
        in but don’t infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to
        different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they
        transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal
        species and begin to infect humans. In the case of SARS-CoV-19, the
        first people infected are thought to have contracted the virus at a food
        market that sold meat, fish and live animals.<br /><br />
        SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters your body through
        your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from
        the transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). It then travels
        to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of
        your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves
        into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body
        tissues.<br />
        If you have COVID-19 it can take several days to develop symptoms — but
        you’re contagious during this time. You are no longer contagious 10 days
        after your symptoms began. The best way to avoid spreading COVID-19 to
        others is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay 6 feet away from others whenever possible.</li>
        <li>
          Wear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash your hands often. If soap isn’t available, use a hand sanitizer
          that contains at least 60% alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid crowded indoor spaces. Open windows to bring in outdoor air as
          much as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that
          could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19.
        </li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</li>
      </ul>

    <div style="display: none" id="malaria">
      <p>
        Malaria is a life-threatening disease primarily found in tropical
        countries. It is both preventable and curable. However, without prompt
        diagnosis and effective treatment, a case of uncomplicated malaria can
        progress to a severe form of the disease, which is often fatal without
        treatment.<br /><br />
        Malaria is not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another;
        the disease is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles
        mosquitoes. Five species of parasites can cause malaria in humans and 2
        of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the
        greatest threat. There are over 400 different species of Anopheles
        mosquitoes and around 40, known as vector species, can transmit the
        disease. <br /><br />This risk of infection is higher in some areas than
        others depending on multiple factors, including the type of local
        mosquitoes. It may also vary according to the season, the risk being
        highest during the rainy season in tropical countries.<br /><br />
        The first symptoms of malaria usually begin within 10–15 days after the
        bite from an infected mosquito. Fever, headache and chills are typically
        experienced, though these symptoms may be mild and difficult to
        recognize as malaria. In malaria endemic areas, people who have
        developed partial immunity may become infected but experience no
        symptoms (asymptomatic infections).<br /><br />
        WHO recommends prompt diagnosis for anyone with suspected malaria. If
        Plasmodium falciparum malaria is not treated within 24 hours, the
        infection can progress to severe illness and death. Severe malaria can
        cause multi-organ failure in adults, while children frequently suffer
        from severe anaemia, respiratory distress or cerebral malaria. Human
        malaria caused by other Plasmodium species can cause significant illness
        and occasionally life-threatening disease. <br /><br />Malaria can be
        diagnosed using tests that determine the presence of the parasites
        causing the disease. There are 2 main types of tests:<br /><br />
        microscopic examination of blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests.
        Diagnostic testing enables health providers to distinguish malarial from
        other causes of febrile illnesses, facilitating appropriate
        treatment.<br /><br />Malaria is a treatable disease. Artemisinin-based
        combination therapies (ACTs) are the most effective antimalarial
        medicines available today and the mainstay of recommended treatment for
        Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest malaria parasite globally.
        <br /><br />ACTs combine 2 active pharmaceuticals with different
        mechanisms of action, including derivates of artemisinin extracted from
        the plant Artemisia annua and a partner drug. The role of the
        artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites during the
        first 3 days of treatment, while the role of the partner drug is to
        eliminate the remaining parasites.<br /><br />
        As no alternative to artemisinin derivatives is expected to enter the
        market for several years, the efficacy of ACTs must be preserved, which
        is why WHO recommends that treatment should only be administered if a
        person tests positive for malaria. WHO does not support the promotion or
        use of Artemisia plant material (whether teas, tablets or capsules) for
        the prevention or treatment of malaria. <br /><br />Over the last
        decade, parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines has emerged as a
        threat in the fight against malaria, particularly in the Greater Mekong
        subregion. WHO is also concerned about more recent reports of
        drug-resistant malaria in Africa. To date, resistance has been
        documented in 3 of the 5 malaria species known to affect humans: P.
        falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. However, nearly all patients
        infected with artemisinin-resistant parasites who are treated with an
        ACT are fully cured, provided the partner drug is highly efficacious.

    <div style="display: none" id="Lassa fever">
      <p>
        Lassa fever is an animal-borne, or zoonotic, acute viral illness spread
        by the common African rat. It is endemic in parts of West Africa
        including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. Neighboring
        countries are also at risk because the animal vector lives throughout
        the region. The first documented case occurred in 1969. Lassa fever is
        named after the town in Nigeria where the first cases occurred.<br /><br />About
        100,000 to 300,000 infections of Lassa fever occur annually, with about
        5,000 deaths. Surveillance for Lassa fever varies between locations so
        these estimates are crude. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia,
        about 10-16% of people admitted to hospitals annually have Lassa fever.
        This shows the serious impact the disease has on the region.<br /><br />
        The reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the
        “multimammate rat” (Mastomys natalensis). Once infected, this rodent is
        able to excrete virus in urine for an extended time period, maybe for
        the rest of its life. Mastomys rodents breed frequently, produce large
        numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of
        west, central, and east Africa. In addition, Mastomys readily colonize
        human homes and areas where food is stored. All of these factors
        contribute to the relatively efficient spread of Lassa virus from
        infected rodents to humans.<br /><br />
        Transmission of Lassa virus to humans occurs most commonly through
        ingestion or inhalation. Mastomys rodents shed the virus in urine and
        droppings and direct contact with these materials, through touching
        soiled objects, eating contaminated food, or exposure to open cuts or
        sores, can lead to infection.<br /><br />
        Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the
        patient comes into contact with the virus. For the majority of Lassa
        fever virus infections (approximately 80%), symptoms are mild and are
        undiagnosed. Mild symptoms include slight fever, general malaise and
        weakness, and headache. In 20% of infected individuals, however, disease
        may progress to more serious symptoms including hemorrhaging (in gums,
        eyes, or nose, as examples), respiratory distress, repeated vomiting,
        facial swelling, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, and shock.
        Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss,
        tremors, and encephalitis. Death may occur within two weeks after
        symptom onset due to multi-organ failure.<br /><br />The most common
        complication of Lassa fever is deafness. Various degrees of deafness
        occur in approximately one-third of infections, and in many cases
        hearing loss is permanent. As far as is known, severity of the disease
        does not affect this complication: deafness may develop in mild as well
        as in severe cases.<br /><br />
        Primary transmission of the Lassa virus from its host to humans can be
        prevented by avoiding contact with Mastomys rodents, especially in the
        geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Putting food away in
        rodent-proof containers and keeping the home clean help to discourage
        rodents from entering homes. Using these rodents as a food source is not
        recommended. Trapping in and around homes can help reduce rodent
        populations; however, the wide distribution of Mastomys in Africa makes
        complete control of this rodent reservoir impractical.<br /><br />
        When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the
        disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be
        avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient
        secretions (called VHF isolation precautions or barrier nursing
        methods). Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as
        masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures,
        such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected
        patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run
        its course.

    <div style="display: none" id="Ebola virus">
      <p>
        Ebolaviruses were first discovered in 1976 when two consecutive
        outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic fever occurred in different parts of
        Central Africa. The first outbreak occurred in the Democratic Republic
        of Congo (formerly Zaire) in a village near the Ebola River, which gave
        the virus its name. The second outbreak occurred in what is now South
        Sudan, approximately 500 miles (850 km) away.<br /><br />
        Initially, public health officials assumed these outbreaks were a single
        event associated with an infected person who traveled between the two
        locations. Scientists later discovered that the two outbreaks were
        caused by two genetically distinct viruses: Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan
        ebolavirus. After this discovery, scientists concluded that these
        viruses came from two different sources and spread independently to
        people in each of the affected areas.<br /><br />Following the discovery
        of these ebolaviruses, scientists studied thousands of animals, insects,
        and plants in search of the source, or reservoir host. It is believed
        that African fruit bats are likely involved in the spread of
        ebolaviruses and may even be the reservoir host. Scientists continue to
        search for conclusive evidence of the bat’s role in transmission of
        ebolaviruses. The most recent ebolavirus to be detected, Bombali virus,
        was identified in samples from bats collected in Sierra Leone.<br /><br />
        ymptoms may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after contact with an
        ebolavirus, with an average of 8 to 10 days. The course of the illness
        typically progresses from “dry” symptoms initially (such as fever, aches
        and pains, and fatigue), and then progresses to “wet” symptoms (such as
        diarrhea and vomiting) as the person becomes sicker. Primary signs and
        symptoms of Ebola disease often include some or several of the
        following:<br /><br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever.</li>
        <li>
          Aches and pains, such as severe headache and muscle and joint pain
        </li>
        <li>Weakness and fatigue</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>
          Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
          vomiting
        </li>
        <li>
          Unexplained hemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising Other symptoms may
          include red eyes, skin rash, and hiccups
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div style="display: none" id="Zika virus">
      <p>
        Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus first identified in Uganda in 1947
        in a Rhesus macaque monkey followed by evidence of infection and disease
        in humans in other African countries in the 1950s. From the 1960s to
        1980s, sporadic human infections were detected across Africa and Asia.
        However, since 2007 outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded
        in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.<br /><br />
        In outbreaks over the last decade Zika virus infection was found to be
        associated with increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. When
        Zika virus emerged in the Americas, with a large epidemic in Brazil in
        2015, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly
        (smaller than normal head size) was first described; there were similar
        findings in French Polynesia upon retrospective review. From February to
        November 2016, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International
        Concern (PHEIC) regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and
        Zika virus, and the causal link between Zika virus and congenital
        malformations was soon confirmed (1,2). Outbreaks of Zika virus disease
        were identified throughout most of the Americas and in other regions
        with established Aedes aegypti mosquitos. Infections were detected in
        travellers from active transmission areas and sexual transmission was
        confirmed as an alternate route of Zika virus infection.<br /><br />
        Cases of Zika virus disease globally declined from 2017 onwards;
        however, Zika virus transmission persists at low levels in several
        countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. In addition, the
        first local mosquito-transmitted Zika virus disease cases were reported
        in Europe in 2019 and Zika virus outbreak activity was detected in India
        in 2021. To date, a total of 89 countries and territories have reported
        evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection; however,
        surveillance remains limited globally.<br /><br />Most people infected
        with Zika virus do not develop symptoms. Among those who do, they
        typically start 3–14 days after infection, are generally mild including
        rash, fever, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise and
        headache, and usually last for 2–7 days. These symptoms are common to
        other arboviral and non-arboviral diseases; thus, the diagnosis of Zika
        virus infection requires laboratory confirmation.<br /><br />here is no
        specific treatment available for Zika virus infection or disease. People
        with symptoms such as rash, fever or joint pain should get plenty of
        rest, drink fluids, and treat symptoms with antipyretics and/or
        analgesics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided until
        dengue virus infections are ruled out because of bleeding risk. If
        symptoms worsen, patients should seek medical care and advice. Pregnant
        women living in areas with Zika transmission or who develop symptoms of
        Zika virus infection should seek medical attention for laboratory
        testing, information, counselling and other clinical care.

    <div style="display: none" id="Hepatitis">
      <p>
        Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is caused by a variety of
        infectious viruses and noninfectious agents leading to a range of health
        problems, some of which can be fatal. There are five main strains of the
        hepatitis virus, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. While they all
        cause liver disease, they differ in important ways including modes of
        transmission, severity of the illness, geographical distribution and
        prevention methods. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease
        in hundreds of millions of people and together are the most common cause
        of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and viral hepatitis-related deaths. An
        estimated 354 million people worldwide live with hepatitis B or C, and
        for most, testing and treatment remain beyond reach.<br /><br />
        Some types of hepatitis are preventable through vaccination. A WHO study
        found that an estimated 4.5 million premature deaths could be prevented
        in low- and middle-income countries by 2030through vaccination,
        diagnostic tests, medicines and education campaigns. WHO’s global
        hepatitis strategy, endorsed by all WHO Member States, aims to reduce
        new hepatitis infections by 90% and deaths by 65% between 2016 and
        2030.<br /><br />
        Many people with hepatitis A, B, C, D or E exhibit only mild symptoms or
        no symptoms at all. Each form of the virus, however, can cause more
        severe symptoms. Symptoms of hepatitis A, B and C may include fever,
        malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort,
        dark-coloured urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of
        the eyes). In some cases, the virus can also cause a chronic liver
        infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the
        liver) or liver cancer. These patients are at risk of death.<br /><br />Safe
        and effective vaccines are available to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV).
        This vaccine also prevents the development of hepatitis D virus (HDV)
        and given at birth strongly reduces transmission risk from mother to
        child. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with antiviral
        agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce
        incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. Only a
        proportion of people with chronic hepatitis B infection will require
        treatment. A vaccine also exists to prevent infections of hepatitis E
        (HEV), although it is not currently widely available. There are no
        specific treatments for HBV and HEV and hospitalization is not usually
        required. It is advised to avoid unnecessary medications due to the
        negative effect on liver function caused by these infections. Hepatitis
        C (HCV) can cause both acute and chronic infection. Some people recover
        on their own, while others develop a life-threatening infection or
        further complications, including cirrhosis or cancer. There is no
        vaccine for hepatitis C. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of
        persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death
        from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment
        remains low. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is most common is low- and
        middle-income countries due to reduced access to clean and reliable
        water sources and the increased risk of contaminated food. A safe and
        effective vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A. Most HAV
        infections are mild, with the majority of people recovering fully and
        developing immunity to further infection. However, these infections can
        also rarely be severe and life threatening due to the risk of liver
        failure.

    <div style="display: none" id="Parkinson's disease">
      <p>
        Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or
        uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty
        with balance and coordination.<br /><br />
        The most prominent signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease occur when
        nerve cells in the basal ganglia, an area of the brain that controls
        movement, become impaired and/or die. Normally, these nerve cells, or
        neurons, produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine. When the
        neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine, which causes
        the movement problems associated with the disease. Scientists still do
        not know what causes the neurons to die.<br /><br />
        Symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen over time. As the disease
        progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. They may
        also have mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression,
        memory difficulties, and fatigue.<br /><br />
        The main therapy for Parkinson’s is levodopa. Nerve cells use levodopa
        to make dopamine to replenish the brain’s dwindling supply. Usually,
        people take levodopa along with another medication called carbidopa.
        Carbidopa prevents or reduces some of the side effects of levodopa
        therapy — such as nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, and restlessness
        — and reduces the amount of levodopa needed to improve symptoms.<br /><br />
        People living with Parkinson’s disease should never stop taking levodopa
        without telling their doctor. Suddenly stopping the drug may have
        serious side effects, like being unable to move or having difficulty
        breathing.

    <div style="display: none" id="Cancer">
      <p>
        Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow
        uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can start
        almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of
        cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called
        cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow
        old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.
        <br /><br />Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or
        damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may
        form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not
        cancerous (benign).<br /><br />
        Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel
        to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called
        metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many
        cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias,
        generally do not. Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby
        tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas
        cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite
        large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening,
        such as benign tumors in the brain.<br /><br />
        Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes
        that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and
        divide.<br /><br />Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:
        of errors that occur as cells divide, of damage to DNA caused by harmful
        substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke
        and ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Prevention
        section has more information.) ,they were inherited from our parents.<br /><br />The
        body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn
        cancerous. But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is
        part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.
        <br /><br />Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic
        changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur.
        Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic
        changes.

    <div style="display: none" id="Arthritis">
      <p>
        Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases are common conditions that cause
        pain, swelling, and limited movement. They affect joints and connective
        tissues around the body. Millions of people in the U.S. have some form
        of arthritis.<br />
        Arthritis means redness and swelling (inflammation) of a joint. A joint
        is where 2 or more bones meet. There are more than 100 different
        arthritis diseases. Rheumatic diseases include any condition that causes
        pain, stiffness, and swelling in joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, or
        bones. Arthritis is usually ongoing (chronic). Arthritis and other
        rheumatic diseases are more common in women than men. They are also
        often linked with old age. But they affect people of all ages.<br /><br />
        The 2 most common forms of arthritis are:<br /><br />
        Osteoarthritis: This is the most common type of arthritis. It is a
        chronic disease of the joints, especially the weight-bearing joints of
        the knee, hip, and spine. It destroys the coating on the ends of bones
        (cartilage) and narrows the joint space. It can also cause bone
        overgrowth, bone spurs, and reduced function. It occurs in most people
        as they age. It may also occur in young people because of an injury or
        overuse.<br /><br />
        Rheumatoid arthritis: This is an inflammatory disease of the joint
        linings. The inflammation may affect all of the joints. It can also
        affect organs such as the heart or lungs.
        <br /><br />
        The cause depends on the type of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is caused by
        the wear and tear of the joint over time or because of overuse.
        Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and scleroderma are caused by the body’s
        immune system attacking the body’s own tissues. Gout is caused by the
        buildup of crystals in the joints. Some forms of arthritis can be linked
        to genes. People with genetic marker HLA-B27 have a higher risk of
        ankylosing spondylitis. For some other forms of arthritis, the cause is
        not known.
